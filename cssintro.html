        <h1>CSS INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p id="blank">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to separate content from design, making websites more visually appealing and easier to maintain. With CSS, you can define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, ensuring a consistent look across different pages and devices. CSS enhances the structure of a webpage, making it responsive and user-friendly.</p>
        <p id="blank">One of the key advantages of CSS is its ability to apply styles globally or selectively. Styles can be added using inline CSS (within an HTML tag), internal CSS (inside a style tag in the head section), or external CSS (a separate .css file linked to the HTML document). The use of external CSS is preferred in professional web development as it keeps styling separate from content, improving code organization and reusability.</p>
        <p id="blank">CSS provides powerful layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, which allow developers to create complex and responsive designs without relying on excessive HTML elements or JavaScript. Additionally, media queries in CSS enable websites to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, making them mobile-friendly. These features make CSS a crucial tool in modern web design and front-end development.</p>
        <p id="blank">Over time, CSS has evolved with new features, such as variables (--primary-color: blue;), animations (@keyframes), and transitions (transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;), allowing developers to create dynamic and engaging user experiences. Understanding CSS is essential for anyone looking to build professional, visually appealing websites. It works alongside HTML and JavaScript, forming the foundation of web development and enabling creative and interactive design possibilities.</p>
