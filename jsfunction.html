        <h1>JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION, METHOD & OBJECTS</h1>
        <p id="blank">Functions, methods, and objects are fundamental concepts in programming that contribute to writing efficient, modular, and maintainable code. These concepts allow developers to structure their programs logically, encapsulate functionality, and manipulate data effectively. By understanding how they work together, programmers can create scalable and reusable code, making their applications more efficient and easier to manage.</p>
        <p id="blank">A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions improve code organization by breaking large programs into smaller, manageable parts. They can accept inputs, known as parameters, and return outputs, making them highly flexible. Functions are essential in programming because they help reduce redundancy, enhance readability, and simplify debugging. In most programming languages, functions can be predefined (built-in functions) or user-defined, allowing developers to create custom operations tailored to their applications.</p>
        <p id="blank">A method is similar to a function but is specifically associated with an object. In object-oriented programming (OOP), methods define the behavior of objects and operate on their data. Methods are invoked using the object they belong to, ensuring that actions performed by an object remain within its context. Unlike standalone functions, methods allow encapsulation, meaning they help maintain the integrity of an object's data by restricting direct manipulation from outside the object. This approach improves code organization and aligns with the principles of OOP, such as inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
        <p id="blank">Objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming and represent real-world entities with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). An object is an instance of a class, which acts as a blueprint defining the structure and behavior of multiple objects. Objects enable code reusability, as the same class can be used to create multiple instances with unique values. By combining objects, methods, and functions, developers can build modular and scalable applications that efficiently handle data and interactions. Mastering these concepts is crucial for writing structured and maintainable code, making programming more effective and adaptable.</p>
