        <h1>HTML TABLES</h1>
        <p id="blank">Tables in HTML are used to organize and display data in a structured, grid-like format. The < table > element serves as the container, while rows are defined using < tr > (table row) and individual data cells using < td > (table data). For column headers, the < th > (table header) element is used, which typically appears bold by default. Tables are commonly used for presenting structured information such as schedules, price lists, and reports.</p>
        <p id="blank">A basic HTML table consists of multiple rows and columns, where each cell contains text, numbers, or other HTML elements. For example, a table displaying student names and their scores might be structured with column headers and corresponding data rows. By default, tables do not have borders or spacing, but these can be added using attributes or CSS. Properly structured tables improve readability and make information easier to interpret.</p>
        <p id="blank">Tables can be enhanced using additional HTML attributes and elements for better organization. The < thead >, < tbody >, and < tfoot > elements help separate headers, main content, and footers, improving accessibility and styling control. Additionally, the colspan and rowspan attributes allow cells to span multiple columns or rows, creating a more flexible and visually appealing layout. These features make tables highly adaptable for different types of content presentation.</p>
        <p id="blank">CSS is often used to style tables, improving their appearance and readability. By applying styles such as border-collapse: collapse;, developers can merge borders for a cleaner look, while background-color and text-align properties help differentiate headers and data. Well-structured and properly styled tables enhance the user experience by making data more visually organized and easier to analyze.</p>
