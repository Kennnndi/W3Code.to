        <h1>CSS LAYOUT</h1>
        <p id="blank">CSS provides powerful tools for designing and structuring webpage layouts, ensuring content is well-organized and visually appealing. By using layout techniques like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and traditional positioning methods, developers can create responsive and adaptive designs that work across various screen sizes. These techniques help align elements efficiently, reducing the need for extra HTML markup. A well-structured layout enhances user experience by making navigation intuitive and content easily accessible.</p>
        <p id="blank">One of the most widely used layout techniques is Flexbox, which simplifies the alignment and distribution of elements within a container. With properties like display: flex;, justify-content, and align-items, Flexbox allows elements to be easily arranged in horizontal or vertical directions. It is especially useful for designing navigation bars, card layouts, and responsive UI components. Flexbox ensures flexibility in design, automatically adjusting elements based on available space.</p>
        <p id="blank">Another powerful layout system is CSS Grid, which provides a two-dimensional approach to designing web pages. Unlike Flexbox, which works in one direction at a time, Grid allows elements to be placed in both rows and columns, offering more control over complex layouts. Properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and gap make it easy to create structured and scalable designs. By combining CSS Grid with media queries, developers can create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices.</p>
        <p id="blank">Aside from Flexbox and Grid, CSS also includes traditional layout techniques like position, float, and display. While these methods are still useful in certain scenarios, modern CSS features have largely replaced them for more efficient and responsive designs. Media queries play a crucial role in layout responsiveness, ensuring elements resize and reposition based on screen width. By mastering CSS layout techniques, developers can build visually appealing, well-structured, and user-friendly websites.</p>
