        <h1>CSS TEXT</h1>
        <p id="blank">CSS provides powerful text styling properties that allow developers to control the appearance, alignment, spacing, and decoration of text on a webpage. The color property sets the text color, while font-family defines the typeface used for a particular section of content. Web-safe fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and Times New Roman are commonly used, but custom fonts can also be applied using @font-face or Google Fonts. Choosing the right font style enhances readability and improves the overall aesthetics of a website.</p>
        <p id="blank">Another important aspect of text styling is size and spacing. The font-size property determines the size of the text and can be set using different units such as pixels (px), ems (em), or relative units like percentages (%). The line-height property controls the spacing between lines of text, improving readability, especially in paragraphs. Additionally, letter-spacing and word-spacing adjust the spacing between characters and words, helping to create a balanced and visually appealing text layout.</p>
        <p id="blank">Text alignment and transformation are also essential in CSS. The text-align property allows text to be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified within a container. The text-transform property changes the capitalization of text, with values such as uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize. This is useful for styling headings, buttons, and labels consistently across a website. Proper alignment and transformation techniques contribute to a clean and professional web design.</p>
        <p id="blank">CSS also provides text decoration and shadow effects to enhance visual appeal. The text-decoration property allows for underlining, overlining, and strikethrough effects, commonly used for links and emphasized content. The text-shadow property adds shadow effects to text, improving contrast and creating stylish effects. These properties allow designers to add creative touches while maintaining readability and accessibility.</p>
        <p id="blank">Lastly, CSS supports responsive typography, ensuring text adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The vw (viewport width) unit allows text to scale based on the user's screen size, while media queries (@media) adjust text properties dynamically. Using CSS variables (--primary-font-size: 16px;) ensures consistency across different sections of the website. By leveraging these CSS text properties effectively, designers can create visually appealing, readable, and well-structured content that enhances the user experience.</p>
