        <h1>HTML FLASH, VIDEO AND AUDIO</h1>
        <p id="blank">HTML provides powerful features for embedding multimedia content, including Flash, video, and audio elements. In earlier web development, Flash was commonly used for animations, interactive applications, and multimedia content. However, due to security vulnerabilities and lack of support on mobile devices, Flash has been largely replaced by modern HTML5 video and audio elements. Today, most browsers no longer support Flash, and developers are encouraged to use native HTML5 solutions for multimedia playback.</p>
        <p id="blank">The < video > element allows embedding videos directly into a webpage without requiring third-party plugins. It supports multiple formats, including MP4 (.mp4), WebM (.webm), and Ogg (.ogg). The < video > tag includes attributes like controls (to display play, pause, and volume controls), autoplay (to start playing automatically), and loop (to repeat the video). Developers can also specify multiple sources using < source > tags to ensure compatibility across different browsers.</p>
        <p id="blank">The < audio > element is used to embed sound files, such as background music, voice recordings, or podcasts. It supports common formats like MP3 (.mp3), WAV (.wav), and Ogg (.ogg). Similar to < video >, the < audio > tag has attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop for better user interaction.</p>
        <p id="blank">Previously, the < object > and < embed > tags were used to include Flash content (.swf files). However, Flash was officially discontinued by Adobe in 2020 and is no longer supported in modern browsers. Websites that still rely on Flash should migrate to HTML5 video, JavaScript, or CSS animations for better security and performance.</p>
