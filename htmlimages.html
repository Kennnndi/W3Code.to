        <h1>HTML IMAGES</h1>
        <p id="blank">Images are an integral part of web design, adding visual appeal and enhancing the overall user experience. In HTML, the < img > tag is used to embed images on a webpage, and it requires the src (source) attribute to specify the file path. The alt (alternative text) attribute provides a textual description of the image, improving accessibility for visually impaired users and enhancing SEO. By using properly optimized images, websites can maintain fast loading speeds while delivering high-quality visuals.</p>
        <p id="blank">HTML supports various image formats, each suited for different purposes. JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) is commonly used for photographs due to its efficient compression and quality balance. PNG (.png) supports transparency and is ideal for logos and graphics with sharp edges. GIF (.gif) allows for simple animations, making it popular for small, looping graphics. SVG (.svg) is a scalable vector format that retains quality at any resolution, perfect for icons and logos. WebP (.webp) is a modern format offering better compression than JPEG and PNG, improving website performance. Choosing the right image format ensures high-quality visuals with minimal impact on loading times.</p>
        <p id="blank">To make images responsive, developers use CSS and HTML techniques to ensure adaptability across different devices and screen sizes. The max-width: 100%; height: auto; CSS rule allows images to scale proportionally, preventing distortion. The < picture > element provides multiple image sources, allowing browsers to load the best-suited version based on screen resolution. Responsive images enhance user experience by adjusting seamlessly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops without compromising quality.</p>
        <p id="blank">Images can also serve as interactive elements by embedding them within links or using them as backgrounds. Wrapping an image inside an <a> tag makes it clickable, directing users to another webpage when clicked. Background images, set using CSS (background-image: url('image.jpg');), allow flexible positioning and styling, making them useful for banners and decorative elements. Proper use of images in both HTML and CSS helps create visually engaging web pages with smooth navigation and functionality.</p>
        <p id="blank">Optimizing images is crucial for maintaining fast website performance. Large image files can slow down page load times, negatively affecting user experience and SEO rankings. Techniques such as compression, lazy loading (loading="lazy"), and using content delivery networks (CDNs) help reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality. By implementing best practices for image optimization and responsiveness, developers can ensure that websites remain visually appealing while maintaining high performance.</p>
