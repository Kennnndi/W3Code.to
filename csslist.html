        <h1>CSS LIST, TABLES AND FORMS</h1>
        <p id="blank">In CSS, lists are used to present structured content in an organized manner, and they can be styled to enhance readability and design. HTML supports three main types of lists: unordered lists (< ul >), ordered lists (< ol >), and definition lists (< dl >). The list-style-type property allows customization of bullet points or numbering, with values such as disc, circle, square, and decimal. Additionally, the list-style-image property lets developers replace default bullets with custom images using url('bullet.png'). Properly styled lists improve content presentation and help users navigate information efficiently.</p>
        <p id="blank">To further enhance lists, CSS offers properties like list-style-position, which controls whether bullets or numbers appear inside or outside the text block. For navigation menus, applying display: flex; or display: inline-block; makes list items appear horizontally rather than the default vertical layout. Developers can also use pseudo-elements like ::before to create custom list markers, adding more flexibility to the design. Lists are commonly used for menus, feature lists, and content organization, making them an essential part of web design.</p>
        <p id="blank">Tables are used to display structured data, and CSS provides numerous ways to style them for better readability and aesthetics. The border-collapse property determines whether table borders are merged (collapse) or separated (separate). The border property adds visible outlines to table cells, improving clarity. Additionally, padding and text-align help control spacing and text alignment within table cells, making the content more visually appealing. Styling tables effectively ensures that data is presented in an organized and readable format.</p>
        <p id="blank">For better user experience, CSS offers properties like nth-child() to style alternate rows, improving readability in large datasets. For example, tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f2f2f2; } applies a striped effect to tables. The hover pseudo-class can also highlight rows when a user hovers over them, making interactive tables more engaging. Responsive table designs use properties like overflow-x: auto; to ensure tables remain accessible on smaller screens.</p>
        <p id="blank">Forms are a crucial part of web interaction, allowing users to submit data, search content, and provide feedback. CSS helps style form elements like text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns for a better user experience. The input, textarea, and select elements can be customized using properties like border, padding, background-color, and font-size to enhance their appearance. Proper form styling ensures that input fields are clear, accessible, and user-friendly.</p>
        <p id="blank">Interactive styles can be applied using pseudo-classes like :focus to highlight active input fields. For instance, input:focus { border-color: blue; } changes the border color when a user clicks inside a text field. Customizing buttons with properties like background-color, border-radius, and box-shadow improves their visual appeal. Additionally, using flexbox or grid layouts helps align form elements properly, creating a well-structured and responsive form design. Well-designed forms enhance usability, making interactions smoother and more visually appealing.</p>
